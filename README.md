## First Unity Game - Cube Add Game

I kept seeing ads on my phone for games like these, so I decided to try making one myself. Using Unity for the first time was an exciting experience. The engine's use of C# felt familiar due to its similarities with C++, making the learning curve manageable.

### What I Learned

- **First Time Using Unity:** Utilizing a pre-built engine like Unity was a revelation. It streamlined the development process significantly compared to my previous C++ project, *Lonely Knight*, where I had to create a game engine from scratch. Unity's intuitive interface and robust functionality allowed me to focus more on game design rather than engine development.
- **Installer Creation:** I learned how to package games into installers. By using Inno Setup Compiler, I created an installer for my game. Although I haven't fully tested it yet, this step was crucial in understanding how games are distributed and installed.
- **Version Control with GitHub:** I used GitHub Desktop to upload my project, finding it more user-friendly than using bash commands. However, I plan to prioritize mastering bash for future version control tasks.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my skills in game development and familiarized me with new tools and workflows.
